    <p style="background: grey;">Bootstrap is a powerful toolkit - a collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tools for creating and
        building web pages and web applications. It is a free and open source project, hosted on
        GitHub, and originally created by (and for) Twitter. After its open source release in 2011,
        Bootstrap became popular very quickly, and not without reason. Web designers and web
        developers like Bootstrap because it is flexible and easy to work with. Its main advantages are
        that it is responsive by design, it maintains wide browser compatibility, it offers consistent design
        by using reusable components, and it is very easy to use and quick to learn. It offers rich
        extensibility using JavaScript, coming with built-in support for jQuery plugins and a
        programmatic JavaScript API. Bootstrap can be used with any IDE or editor, and any server
        side technology and language, from ASP.NET to PHP to Ruby on Rails.</p>
