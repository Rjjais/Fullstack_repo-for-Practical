         system on their own. Full-stack development is a blanket term for both front and back end development, along with APIs and version control, itâ€™s the all in one package for your web app to run.
        A full-stack developer knows both the server-side scripting and development of UI/UX. The developer does the work of both a front-end developer and a back-end developer. Hiring a full stack developer means half the number of people you hire.</p>
